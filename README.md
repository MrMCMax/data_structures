# Data Structures in Java
Java Data Structures repository, compiled by me (MrMCMax).

Several of the data structures are implemented by me, like the Graph ones. Some others are drawn from the Data Structures 1 subject taught at UPV, and implemented by some of the teachers. In the top comment of the files, their name should appear.
